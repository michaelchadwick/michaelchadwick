- 👋 Hello! My name is Michael Chadwick, a.k.a. Nebyoolae, and I'm both a software dev and audio guy.
- 🎵 Making patterned, and unpatterned, air movements is fun. It crosses over into coding often.
- 🌱 I mainly do webdev, as I like seeing the fruits of my labor instantly and having it accessible anywhere Internet exists. Currently learning [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com).
- 💬 Besides learning programming languages, I also really enjoy learning human languages, and am pretty active on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/nebyoolae).
