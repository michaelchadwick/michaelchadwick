- 👋 Hello! My name is Michael Chadwick, a.k.a. Nebyoolae, and I'm both a software developer and audio guy
- 🎵 I like to make patterned, and sometimes unpatterned, air movements, and that interest crosses over into coding often
- 🌱 I mainly do webdev, as I like seeing the fruits of my labor instantly and having it accessible anywhere Internet exists
- 💬 Besides learning programming languages, I also really enjoy learning human languages, and am pretty active on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/nebyoolae)
